Londoners are under starter's orders as the city gets ready for the Olympic Games, which will begin one year today.
To mark the start of the 366-day countdown (2012 is a leap year), special events are planned for today.
The design of the Olympic medals will be unveiled tonight in a live ceremony from Trafalgar Square.
Over at the brand new Aquatics Centre, Britain's star diver Tom Daley is going to perform an official launch dive into the Olympic pool.
